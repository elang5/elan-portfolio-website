                            At the start of 2019, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a developer. In Thinkful’s Software Engineering Immersion program, I am learning to build dynamic, scalable web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and React. I have always been fascinated by human interaction with technology, and my tech savvy emerged at a young age. At age 11, I started building computers and soon after began dabbling in game development using GameMaker Studio.<br>
                            <br>
                            Despite my passion for all aspects of technology, it had remained entirely hobby-based until this year. In my undergraduate studies, I pursued music, then medicine, and finally I settled on psychology. As a research assistant, I discovered a passion for statistics and as such, I was exposed to R. I also worked on the content for a smoking cessation app. This experience further motivated me to pursue programming in some capacity and allowed me to see how my passion for psychology could interface with technology. <br>
                            <br>
                            Outside of programming, my primary passions are music and nature. Having grown up in Portland, OR, hiking, backpacking, skiing, and rock climbing are very important to me. Furthermore, I am a classically trained cellist with 20 years of experience playing with symphonies, chamber music groups, rock bands, producers, and so on. I believe the intersection of music and technology is extremely powerful, and it is a great dream of mine to someday work for a music-focused tech company. <br>
                            <br>
                            Another professional interest (and passion) of mine is to help adolescents with substance abuse issues. This was my motivation in pursuing psychology, and before enrolling in Thinkful’s program, I had planned to matriculate into a clinical psychology and addiction counseling graduate program this fall. Despite my current career transition, I believe that there are so many ways in which technology can be utilized to help people, even in the context of addiction. I can’t wait to be a part of this and much more.<br>

                        This is a quiz app which utilizes the Open Trivia Database API to generate a number of questions to display to the user. The user’s score is kept in the status bar, as well as the high score of the current game. A user may play as many games in their local browser window and the high score will update accordingly. Flexbox was used for the simple, yet straightforward design interface.
