            <p>
                At the start of 2019, I decided to pursue my dream of becoming a developer. In Thinkful’s Software Engineering Immersion program, I am learning to build dynamic, scalable web applications using JavaScript, TypeScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and React. I have always been fascinated by human interaction with technology, and my tech savvy emerged at a young age. At age 11, I started building computers and soon after began dabbling in game development using GameMaker Studio.

            <p>
                Despite my passion for all aspects of technology, it had remained entirely hobby-based until this year. In my undergraduate studies, I pursued music, then medicine, and finally I settled on psychology. As a research assistant, I discovered a passion for statistics and as such, I was exposed to R. I also worked on the content for a smoking cessation app. This experience further motivated me to pursue programming in some capacity and allowed me to see how my passion for psychology could interface with technology. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of programming, my primary passions are music and nature. Having grown up in Portland, OR, hiking, backpacking, skiing, and rock climbing are very important to me. Furthermore, I am a classically trained cellist with 20 years of experience playing with symphonies, chamber music groups, rock bands, producers, and so on. I believe the intersection of music and technology is extremely powerful, and it is a great dream of mine to someday work for a music-focused tech company.

                Another professional interest (and passion) of mine is to help adolescents with substance abuse issues. This was my motivation in pursuing psychology, and before enrolling in Thinkful’s program, I had planned to matriculate into a clinical psychology and addiction counseling graduate program this fall. Despite my current career transition, I believe that there are so many ways in which technology can be utilized to help people, even in the context of addiction. I can’t wait to be a part of this and much more.
